# uo-outlands-profiles
This repo is used for storing Profiles related to Ultima Online Classic Client. Currently tested with Outlands shard w/ UO Razor.

## Why is this needed?

When a character is new to outlands the entire interface at its bare bones is nearly unplayable.  This is just a simple attempt at simplfying UO for new players as well as those who want to learn or contribute to making the learning curve a bit less burdensome.

Although it is beyond me how a 25+ year old game doesn't provide general features such as Macros, Hotkeys, or Interface interactions you can greatly customize it to your liking.  These are general purpose templates with the following items customized for you.  What you can assume is profile specific naming will reflect the expected experience.  I.e. A `Miner` template will give you the `Miner` customizations but you are free to adjust this to your playstyle.

1. Cooldowns - provided by Jase and updated here as cooldown meters are nice to see to know when you can pop off other skills.
1. Macros also included for each template. 
1. Macros Buttons also included for each template.
1. Counter Grid with preconfigured item types based on the template used.
1. Targeting, Spell, WASD movement, and much more.
1. Preconfigured Video Settings
1. NamePlate Adjustments


## How to update your profiles

1. Download the zip files from GitHub by clicking the following link to download the repo code [HERE](https://github.com/cwjking611/uo-outlands-profiles/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

These specific profiles are meant to be loaded into the character files to replace the various `*.xml` files.

Here I can see 3 different accounts I've creatd with my single outlands Id:

Clicking the accounts created will reveal the characters currently created on the accounts as shown below. I click on the account > and now see my `character names`.

Double Click the Character Folder and paste the contents of whichever profile template you wish to use located in `./Profiles` 

Load your character by logging in.

Once you log in your interface should be updated. 
Once Logged in you can pull up your paperdoll by clicking the top bar with an > on it and Go `Gumps` and `Paper Doll` 
Go to Macros to update any Macros and Assignment hotkeys you may not like
Go to Cooldowns to update any Specific ones possibly missing

## Moving Profiles between characters that you want to share.

1. Once finsihed testing profiles you may want to move and shift them around between other characters. Its good to simply use a fresh character for profile testing and cloning.
1. To clone profiles from the character you just log into the character that you want the profile on and go to `Paper Dolla` > `Options` > `Profile Manager` > `Clone`
1. Here you can choose the template account, shard, and character to copy specific profile elements from.
1. Just play around and experiemnt with what works for you.
